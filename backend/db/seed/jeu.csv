Ces ateliers sont répartis dans une grille dont on active une rangée ou une colonne entière pour travailler sur différents Katanas en même temps. À chaque activation, il faut avoir en stock la ressource nécessaire, puis bouger la tuile Katana jusqu'au prochain atelier. Mais attention ! Si avoir beaucoup de Katanas sur la grille permet d'activer plusieurs ateliers en une seule action, cela augmente aussi le risque qu'ils se gênent les uns les autres et ne progressent pas avec fluidité d'une étape à l'autre.
